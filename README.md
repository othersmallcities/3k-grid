# 3k grid

## What is it?

It is a small responsive mobile first grid, I have put together for a project. This is basically the 0.5 version.

In its basic form it is only 3k big, with extensions 5k, but I have hope I can make it a even smaller.

Its written in SASS and compiled with compass, but should work without compass. The file structure was an early experiment how to organise files better; sadly I failed and will redo this in the future.

A demo can be found here on [taotsu.net](http://taotsu.net/3k/).

## What it is not?

This is by no means finished. It can be used in production (I have), but I would not recommend it at this time.

*************

One thing about the license: Parts of the gird are based on the first introduction of the foundation 2 grid in [.net magazine](http://www.creativebloq.com/design/building-modern-grid-system-5122962). I have rewritten it to be mobile first and tried to compress it as much as possible.

Since Foundation has an **MIT license** and this contains some original ideas from Foundation, I choose the same.

Otherwise, any non-code content is licensed [cc-by](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

Feedback is welcome and I hope I can push version 1.0 soon.
